# Telegram Chatbot with OpenAI Integration

This is a Telegram chatbot integrated with OpenAI's language model for generating responses.

## Prerequisites

Before you run the code, make sure you have the following:

- Python 3 installed on your system.
- Telegram API token for your bot.
- OpenAI API key.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   \`\`\`bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
   \`\`\`

2. Install the required dependencies:

   \`\`\`bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   \`\`\`

3. Create a \`.env\` file in the root directory and add your Telegram API token and OpenAI API key:

   \`\`\`plaintext
   TELEGRAM_API_TOKEN=your_telegram_api_token
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   \`\`\`

## Usage

Run the Python script \`main.py\`:

\`\`\`bash
python main.py
\`\`\`

## Bot Commands

- \`/start\`: Start the conversation.
- \`/help\`: Display help information.

## How it Works

1. The bot listens for user messages.
2. When a message is received, it sends it to the OpenAI language model for generating a response.
3. The response is then sent back to the user.

## Customization

- You can modify the behavior of the bot by adjusting the parameters passed to the OpenAI language model.
- Customize the responses or add more features as per your requirements.
